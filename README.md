# Algerian Forest Fire Prediction

This project aims to predict forest fire incidents in Algeria using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as weather conditions, vegetation indices, and historical fire data, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict the occurrence and severity of forest fires in Algeria.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical forest fire records and relevant environmental variables collected from different regions of Algeria. The dataset includes features such as temperature, wind speed, Rain, Region, Classes and the occurrence of forest fires.
